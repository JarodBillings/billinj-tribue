                After the sale of his first company, Zip2 in 1999, Elon used the from the sale to create his a new
                company X.Com. One
                year later
                the new company was aquired by the software company Cofinity, which had a money-transfer function named
                "Paypal".
                In 2002, after years of growth, the service was aquired for $1.5B from Ebay. Since that time the
                company has
                exploded to a valuation of $105B.

                After stepping down as the CEO of Paypal in 2002, Elon focused his efforts on a more ambitous project.
                Musk had started the
                Mars Oasis project with the goal of creating a greenhouse on the planet Mars. After meeting with
                companies to purchase
                the rockets needed to get a spacecraft to Mars, Musk was frusted at the high cost of a project.
                Concluding that he could get the job done better, Musk formed SpaceX, with a new goal of habiting the
                red planet.
                In 2015 at the head of Musk, SpaceX was able to launch a rocket and succesfully land it pack onto the
                launch pad.

                With the thought of space travel on his mind, Musk decided to also create a more down to earth project.
                The
                goal of this new
                project was the design and engineering of an all electric vehicle. Although many electric cars had been
                tried before,
                it was only until Musk's innovation did they become a reality. Following seven years of research and
                development, Tesla Motors released the Tesla Roadster. This was the first all electric-car to travel
                more than
                200 miles per charge. Since that, Tesla has focused on designing a car to be fully self-driving. As of
                2019, Telsa Motors
                has raised $44B in valuation to make this a reality.
